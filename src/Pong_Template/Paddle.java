	//Step 1: Create instance variables for the paddle's x, y, width, and height
	//Do not instantiate any of these variables - we will do that in the constructor
	
	public Paddle() { //This is the constructor
		//Step 2: set the variables x, y, width, and height to inputs from the constructor
		
		
		
		
		
	}
	
	//Step 3: Create a public method called "move" with a void return type and an input of "String s"
	//This method will be used by the GamePanel class to move the paddles up and down
	//Include Step 4 in this method
	
	
		//Step 4: Using if statements...
		//If the string is "up", then move the paddle up 10
		//If the string is "down", then move the paddle down 10
		//Hint: Adjust the y value
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	
	//Step 5: Create a public method called draw with a void return type and an input of "Graphics g"
	//This method will be used by the GamePanel class to draw the paddle
	//Include Steps 6 and 7 in this method
	
	
		//Step 6: Use the Graphics method "setColor" to set the color of the paddle to "Color.WHITE"
		
		
		//Step 7: Use the Graphics method "fillRect" with conditions "x, y, width, height" to draw the paddle
		
		
	
	//Congratulations! You are all done with the Paddle class
